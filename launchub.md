Hi Georgi, 

Lyuben Belov (the Launchub Ventures founder) and I (Raya Yunakova) are trying to get in touch with you.

We love what you're doing with ggml and would obviously be keen to discuss a potential investment.

I uderstand you're not interested in funding so I won't push it but we still wanted to meet you. 

You're doing something quite exciting and we'd like to know any Bulgarian who is working on things that matter.

If you're open to meet us and have a chat (no strings attached) please connect with us:
