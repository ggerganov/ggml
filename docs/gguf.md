# GGUF

GGUF is a file format for storing models for inference with GGML and executors based on GGML. GGUF is a binary format that is designed for fast loading and saving of models, and for ease of reading. Models are traditionally developed using PyTorch or another framework, and then converted to GGUF for use in GGML.

It is a successor file format to GGML, GGMF and GGJT, and is designed to be unambiguous by containing all the information needed to load a model. It is also designed to be extensible, so that new information can be added to models without breaking compatibility.

For more information about the motivation behind GGUF, see [Historical State of Affairs](#historical-state-of-affairs).

## Specification

GGUF is a format based on the existing GGJT, but makes a few changes to the format to make it more extensible and easier to use. The following features are desired:

- Single-file deployment: they can be easily distributed and loaded, and do not require any external files for additional information.
- Extensible: new features can be added to GGML-based executors/new information can be added to GGUF models without breaking compatibility with existing models.
- `mmap` compatibility: models can be loaded using `mmap` for fast loading and saving.
- Easy to use: models can be easily loaded and saved using a small amount of code, with no need for external libraries, regardless of the language used.
- Full information: all information needed to load a model is contained in the model file, and no additional information needs to be provided by the user.

The key difference between GGJT and GGUF is the use of a key-value structure for the hyperparameters (now referred to as metadata), rather than a list of untyped values. This allows for new metadata to be added without breaking compatibility with existing models, and to annotate the model with additional information that may be useful for inference or for identifying the model.

### File Structure

GGUF files are structured as follows. They use a global alignment specified in the `general.alignment` metadata field, referred to as `ALIGNMENT` below. Where required, the file is padded with `0x00` bytes to the next multiple of `general.alignment`.

Fields, including arrays, are written sequentially without alignment unless otherwise specified.

Models are little-endian by default. They can also come in big-endian for use with big-endian computers; in this case, all values (including metadata values and tensors) will also be big-endian. At the time of writing, there is no way to determine if a model is big-endian; this may be rectified in future versions. If no additional information is provided, assume the model is little-endian.

## Standardized key-value pairs

The following key-value pairs are standardized. This list may grow in the future as more use cases are discovered. Where possible, names are shared with the original model definitions to make it easier to map between the two.

Not all of these are required, but they are all recommended. Keys that are required are bolded. For omitted pairs, the reader should assume that the value is unknown and either default or error as appropriate.

The community can develop their own key-value pairs to carry additional data. However, these should be namespaced with the relevant community name to avoid collisions. For example, the `rustformers` community might use `rustformers.` as a prefix for all of their keys.

If a particular community key is widely used, it may be promoted to a standardized key.

By convention, most counts/lengths/etc are `uint64` unless otherwise specified. This is to allow for larger models to be supported in the future. Some models may use `uint32` for their values; it is recommended that readers support both.

### General

#### Required

- **`general.architecture: string`**: describes what architecture this model implements. All lowercase ASCII, with only `[a-z0-9]+` characters allowed. Known values include:
  - `llama`
  - `mpt`
  - `gptneox`
  - `gptj`
  - `gpt2`
  - `bloom`
  - `falcon`
  - `rwkv`
- **`general.quantization_version: uint32`**: The version of the quantization format. Not required if the model is not quantized (i.e. no tensors are quantized). If any tensors are quantized, this _must_ be present. This is separate to the quantization scheme of the tensors itself; the quantization version may change without changing the scheme's name (e.g. the quantization scheme is Q5_K, and the quantization version is 4).
- **`general.alignment: uint32`**: the global alignment to use, as described above. This can vary to allow for different alignment schemes, but it must be a multiple of 8. Some writers may not write the alignment. If the alignment is **not** specified, assume it is `32`.

#### General metadata

- `general.name`: The name of the model. This should be a human-readable name that can be used to identify the model. It should be unique within the community that the model is defined in.
- `general.author`: The author of the model.
- `general.url`: URL to the model's homepage. This can be a GitHub repo, a paper, etc.
- `general.description: string`: free-form description of the model including anything that isn't covered by the other fields
- `general.license: string`: License of the model, expressed as a [SPDX license expression](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2-draft/SPDX-license-expressions/) (e.g. `"MIT OR Apache-2.0`). Do not include any other information, such as the license text or the URL to the license.
- `general.file_type: uint32`: An enumerated value describing the type of the majority of the tensors in the file. Optional; can be inferred from the tensor types.
  - `ALL_F32 = 0`
  - `MOSTLY_F16 = 1`
  - `MOSTLY_Q4_0 = 2`
  - `MOSTLY_Q4_1 = 3`
  - `MOSTLY_Q4_1_SOME_F16 = 4`
  - `MOSTLY_Q4_2 = 5` (support removed)
  - `MOSTLY_Q4_3 = 6` (support removed)
  - `MOSTLY_Q8_0 = 7`
  - `MOSTLY_Q5_0 = 8`
  - `MOSTLY_Q5_1 = 9`
  - `MOSTLY_Q2_K = 10`
  - `MOSTLY_Q3_K_S = 11`
  - `MOSTLY_Q3_K_M = 12`
  - `MOSTLY_Q3_K_L = 13`
  - `MOSTLY_Q4_K_S = 14`
  - `MOSTLY_Q4_K_M = 15`
  - `MOSTLY_Q5_K_S = 16`
  - `MOSTLY_Q5_K_M = 17`
  - `MOSTLY_Q6_K = 18`

#### Source metadata

Information about where this model came from. This is useful for tracking the provenance of the model, and for finding the original source if the model is modified. For a model that was converted from GGML, for example, these keys would point to the model that was converted from.

- `general.source.url: string`: URL to the source of the model. Can be a GitHub repo, a paper, etc.
- `general.source.huggingface.repository: string`: Hugging Face model repository that this model is either hosted on or based on

### LLM

In the following, `[llm]` is used to fill in for the name of a specific LLM architecture. For example, `llama` for LLaMA, `mpt` for MPT, etc. If mentioned in an architecture's section, it is required for that architecture, but not all keys are required for all architectures. Consult the relevant section for more information.

- `[llm].context_length: uint64`: Also known as `n_ctx`. length of the context (in tokens) that the model was trained on. For most architectures, this is the hard limit on the length of the input. Architectures, like RWKV, that are not reliant on transformer-style attention may be able to handle larger inputs, but this is not guaranteed.
- `[llm].embedding_length: uint64`: Also known as `n_embd`. Embedding layer size.
- `[llm].block_count: uint64`: The number of blocks of attention+feed-forward layers (i.e. the bulk of the LLM). Does not include the input or embedding layers.
- `[llm].feed_forward_length: uint64`: Also known as `n_ff`. The length of the feed-forward layer.
- `[llm].use_parallel_residual: bool`: Whether or not the parallel residual logic should be used.
- `[llm].tensor_data_layout: string`: When a model is converted to GGUF, tensors may be rearranged to improve performance. This key describes the layout of the tensor data. This is not required; if not present, it is assumed to be `reference`.
  - `reference`: tensors are laid out in the same order as the original model
  - further options can be found for each architecture in their respective sections
- `[llm].expert_count: uint32`: Number of experts in MoE models (optional for non-MoE arches).
- `[llm].expert_used_count: uint32`: Number of experts used during each token token evaluation (optional for non-MoE arches).

#### Attention

- `[llm].attention.head_count: uint64`: Also known as `n_head`. Number of attention heads.
- `[llm].attention.head_count_kv: uint64`: The number of heads per group used in Grouped-Query-Attention. If not present or if present and equal to `[llm].attention.head_count`, the model does not use GQA.
- `[llm].attention.max_alibi_bias: float32`: The maximum bias to use for ALiBI.
- `[llm].attention.clamp_kqv: float32`: Value (`C`) to clamp the values of the `Q`, `K`, and `V` tensors between (`[-C, C]`).
- `[llm].attention.layer_norm_epsilon: float32`: Layer normalization epsilon.
- `[llm].attention.layer_norm_rms_epsilon: float32`: Layer RMS normalization epsilon.

#### RoPE

- `[llm].rope.dimension_count: uint64`: The number of rotary dimensions for RoPE.
- `[llm].rope.freq_base: float32`: The base frequency for RoPE.

##### Scaling

The following keys describe RoPE scaling parameters:

- `[llm].rope.scaling.type: string`: Can be `none`, `linear`, or `yarn`.
- `[llm].rope.scaling.factor: float32`: A scale factor for RoPE to adjust the context length.
- `[llm].rope.scaling.original_context_length: uint32_t`: The original context length of the base model.
- `[llm].rope.scaling.finetuned: bool`: True if model has been finetuned with RoPE scaling.

Note that older models may not have these keys, and may instead use the following key:

- `[llm].rope.scale_linear: float32`: A linear scale factor for RoPE to adjust the context length.

It is recommended that models use the newer keys if possible, as they are more flexible and allow for more complex scaling schemes. Executors will need to support both indefinitely.

#### Models

The following sections describe the metadata for each model architecture. Each key specified _must_ be present.

##### LLaMA

- `llama.context_length`

- `falcon.attention.head_count_kv`
- `falcon.attention.use_norm`
- `falcon.attention.layer_norm_epsilon`

###### Optional

- `falcon.tensor_data_layout`:

  - `jploski` (author of the original GGML implementation of Falcon):

    ```python
    # The original query_key_value tensor contains n_head_kv "kv groups",
    # each consisting of n_head/n_head_kv query weights followed by one key
    # and one value weight (shared by all query heads in the kv group).
    # This layout makes it a big pain to work with in GGML.
    # So we rearrange them here,, so that we have n_head query weights
    # followed by n_head_kv key weights followed by n_head_kv value weights,
    # in contiguous fashion.

    if "query_key_value" in src:
        qkv = model[src].view(
            n_head_kv, n_head // n_head_kv + 2, head_dim, head_dim * n_head)

        q = qkv[:, :-2 ].reshape(n_head * head_dim, head_dim * n_head)
        k = qkv[:, [-2]].reshape(n_head_kv * head_dim, head_dim * n_head)
        v = qkv[:, [-1]].reshape(n_head_kv * head_dim, head_dim * n_head)

        model[src] = torch.cat((q,k,v)).reshape_as(model[src])
    ```

##### RWKV

The vocabulary size is the same as the number of rows in the `head` matrix.

- `rwkv.architecture_version: uint32`: The only allowed value currently is 4. Version 5 is expected to appear some time in the future.
- `rwkv.context_length: uint64`: Length of the context used during training or fine-tuning. RWKV is able to handle larger context than this limit, but the output quality may suffer.
- `rwkv.block_count: uint64`
- `rwkv.embedding_length: uint64`
- `rwkv.feed_forward_length: uint64`

##### Whisper

Keys that do not have types defined should be assumed to share definitions with `llm.` keys.
(For example, `whisper.context_length` is equivalent to `llm.context_length`.)
This is because they are both transformer models.

- `whisper.encoder.context_length`
- `whisper.encoder.embedding_length`
- `whisper.encoder.block_count`
- `whisper.encoder.mels_count: uint64`
- `whisper.encoder.attention.head_count`

- `whisper.decoder.context_length`
- `whisper.decoder.embedding_length`
- `whisper.decoder.block_count`
- `whisper.decoder.attention.head_count`

#### Prompting

**TODO**: Include prompt format, and/or metadata about how it should be used (instruction, conversation, autocomplete, etc).

### LoRA

**TODO**: Figure out what metadata is needed for LoRA. Probably desired features:

- match an existing model exactly, so that it can't be misapplied
- be marked as a LoRA so executors won't try to run it by itself

Should this be an architecture, or should it share the details of the original model with additional fields to mark it as a LoRA?

### Tokenizer

The following keys are used to describe the tokenizer of the model. It is recommended that model authors support as many of these as possible, as it will allow for better tokenization quality with supported executors.

#### GGML

GGML supports an embedded vocabulary that enables inference of the model, but implementations of tokenization using this vocabulary (i.e. `llama.cpp`'s tokenizer) may have lower accuracy than the original tokenizer used for the model. When a more accurate tokenizer is available and supported, it should be used instead.

It is not guaranteed to be standardized across models, and may change in the future. It is recommended that model authors use a more standardized tokenizer if possible.

- `tokenizer.ggml.model: string`: The name of the tokenizer model.
  - `llama`: Llama style SentencePiece (tokens and scores extracted from HF `tokenizer.model`)
  - `replit`: Replit style SentencePiece (tokens and scores extracted from HF `spiece.model`)
  - `gpt2`: GPT-2 / GPT-NeoX style BPE (tokens extracted from HF `tokenizer.json`)
  - `rwkv`: RWKV tokenizer
- `tokenizer.ggml.tokens: array[string]`: A list of tokens indexed by the token ID used by the model.
- `tokenizer.ggml.scores: array[float32]`: If present, the score/probability of each token. If not present, all tokens are assumed to have equal probability. If present, it must have the same length and index as `tokens`.
- `tokenizer.ggml.token_type: array[int32]`: The token type (1=normal, 2=unknown, 3=control, 4=user defined, 5=unused, 6=byte). If present, it must have the same length and index as `tokens`.
- `tokenizer.ggml.merges: array[string]`: If present, the merges of the tokenizer. If not present, the tokens are assumed to be atomic.
- `tokenizer.ggml.added_tokens: array[string]`: If present, tokens that were added after training.

##### Special tokens

- `tokenizer.ggml.bos_token_id: uint32`: Beginning of sequence marker
- `tokenizer.ggml.eos_token_id: uint32`: End of sequence marker
- `tokenizer.ggml.unknown_token_id: uint32`: Unknown token
- `tokenizer.ggml.separator_token_id: uint32`: Separator token
- `tokenizer.ggml.padding_token_id: uint32`: Padding token

#### Hugging Face

Hugging Face maintains their own `tokenizers` library that supports a wide variety of tokenizers. If your executor uses this library, it may be able to use the model's tokenizer directly.

- `tokenizer.huggingface.json: string`: the entirety of the HF `tokenizer.json` for a given model (e.g. <https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-7b-instruct/blob/main/tokenizer.json>). Included for compatibility with executors that support HF tokenizers directly.

#### Other

Other tokenizers may be used, but are not necessarily standardized. They may be executor-specific. They will be documented here as they are discovered/further developed.

- `tokenizer.rwkv.world: string`: a RWKV World tokenizer, like [this](https://github.com/BlinkDL/ChatRWKV/blob/main/tokenizer/rwkv_vocab_v20230424.txt). This text file should be included verbatim.
- `tokenizer.chat_template : string`: a Jinja template that specifies the input format expected by the model. For more details see: <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/chat_templating>

### Computation graph

This is a future extension and still needs to be discussed, and may necessitate a new GGUF version. At the time of writing, the primary blocker is the stabilization of the computation graph format.

A sample computation graph of GGML nodes could be included in the model itself, allowing an executor to run the model without providing its own implementation of the architecture. This would allow for a more consistent experience across executors, and would allow for more complex architectures to be supported without requiring the executor to implement them.

## Standardized tensor names

To minimize complexity and maximize compatibility, it is recommended that models using the transformer architecture use the following naming convention for their tensors:

### Base layers

`AA.weight` `AA.bias`

where `AA` can be:

- `token_embd`: Token embedding layer
- `pos_embd`: Position embedding layer
- `output_norm`: Output normalization layer
- `output`: Output layer

### Attention and feed-forward layer blocks

`blk.N.BB.weight` `blk.N.BB.bias`

where N signifies the block number a layer belongs to, and where `BB` could be:

- `attn_norm`: Attention normalization layer
- `attn_norm_2`: Attention normalization layer
- `attn_qkv`: Attention query-key-value layer
- `attn_q`: Attention query layer
- `attn_k`: Attention key layer
- `attn_v`: Attention value layer
- `attn_output`: Attention output layer

- `ffn_norm`: Feed-forward network normalization layer
- `ffn_up`: Feed-forward network "up" layer
- `ffn_gate`: Feed-forward network "gate" layer
- `ffn_down`: Feed-forward network "down" layer
- `ffn_gate_inp`: Expert-routing layer for the Fee-forward network in MoE models
- `ffn_gate_exp`: Feed-forward network "gate" layer per expert in MoE models
- `ffn_down_exp`: Feed-forward network "down" layer per expert in MoE models
- `ffn_up_exp`: Feed-forward network "up" layer per expert in MoE models

## Version History

This document is actively updated to describe the current state of the metadata, and these changes are not tracked outside of the commits.

However, the format _itself_ has changed. The following sections describe the changes to the format itself.

### v3

Adds big-endian support.

### v2

Most countable values (lengths, etc) were changed from `uint32` to `uint64` to allow for larger models to be supported in the future.

### v1

Initial version.

## Historical State of Affairs

The following information is provided for context, but is not necessary to understand the rest of this document.

### Overview

At present, there are three GGML file formats floating around for LLMs:

- **GGML** (unversioned): baseline format, with no versioning or alignment.
- **GGMF** (versioned): the same as GGML, but with versioning. Only one version exists.
- **GGJT**: Aligns the tensors to allow for use with `mmap`, which requires alignment. v1, v2 and v3 are identical, but the latter versions use a different quantization scheme that is incompatible with previous versions.

GGML is primarily used by the examples in `ggml`, while GGJT is used by `llama.cpp` models. Other executors may use any of the three formats, but this is not 'officially' supported.

These formats share the same fundamental structure:

- a magic number with an optional version number
- model-specific hyperparameters, including
  - metadata about the model, such as the number of layers, the number of heads, etc.
  - a `ftype` that describes the type of the majority of the tensors,
    - for GGML files, the quantization version is encoded in the `ftype` divided by 1000
- an embedded vocabulary, which is a list of strings with length prepended. The GGMF/GGJT formats embed a float32 score next to the strings.
- finally, a list of tensors with their length-prepended name, type, and (aligned, in the case of GGJT) tensor data

Notably, this structure does not identify what model architecture the model belongs to, nor does it offer any flexibility for changing the structure of the hyperparameters. This means that the only way to add new hyperparameters is to add them to the end of the list, which is a breaking change for existing models.

### Drawbacks

Unfortunately, over the last few months, there are a few issues that have become apparent with the existing models:

- There's no way to identify which model architecture a given model is for, because that information isn't present
  - Similarly, existing programs cannot intelligently fail upon encountering new architectures
- Adding or removing any new hyperparameters is a breaking change, which is impossible for a reader to detect without using heuristics
- Each model architecture requires its own conversion script to their architecture's variant of GGML
- Maintaining backwards compatibility without breaking the structure of the format requires clever tricks, like packing the quantization version into the ftype, which are not guaranteed to be picked up by readers/writers, and are not consistent between the two formats

### Why not other formats?

There are a few other formats that could be used, but issues include:

- requiring additional dependencies to load or save the model, which is complicated in a C environment
- limited or no support for 4-bit quantization
- existing cultural expectations (e.g. whether or not the model is a directory or a file)
- lack of support for embedded vocabularies
- lack of control over direction of future development

Ultimately, it is likely that GGUF will remain necessary for the foreseeable future, and it is better to have a single format that is well-documented and supported by all executors than to contort an existing format to fit the needs of GGML.
